                Frontend development is all about creating the visual and interactive parts of websites and apps that users see and click on. It uses three main building blocks: **HTML** for the structure, **CSS** for making things look stylish and beautiful (colors, fonts, layouts), and **JavaScript** for adding movement and interactivity.
                <br><br>
                **Why it's fun:** A great frontend developer ensures that a website looks amazing on small phones and large computers (responsive design), and is easy for everyone to use. It's a very creative and rewarding job where you bring designs to life!
